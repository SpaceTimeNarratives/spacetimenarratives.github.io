Ignatius Ezeani has presented our first project paper titled "Extracting Imprecise Geographical and Temporal References from Journey Narratives" 
at the [https://text2story23.inesctec.pt/](Text2Story 2023 workshop) in Dublin, Ireland. 
Text2Story 2023 is the Sixth International Workshop on Narrative Extraction from Texts held in conjunction with the 45th European Conference on Information Retrieval. 
The [https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3370/paper11.pdf](demo paper) illustrates how we are extending current geographical text analysis techniques and
applying them to analyses of two large corpora: one a corpus of travel writing about the
English Lake District, predominantly written in the 18th and 19th centuries; the other, a corpus
of Holocaust survivor testimonies. 
Our prototype NLP pipeline was demonstrated at the workshop and is available open source as a series of
