On Monday 17th April 2023, we held our first expert workshop at the British Library in London, UK. 
The meeting had two main aims:
1. To receive feedback and advice on the project's work from a wide set of partners
2. To discuss how the project's research can contribute to a wider set of projects and agendas

Thanks to all the members of the expert meeting who were able to attend in person or remotely for providing advice and guidance on our project achievements so far, and plans for the future.
