Between Monday 15th and Wednesday 17th May 2023, project members attended a workshop at King's College London
co-hosted by the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) and the Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure (CLARIN).
The theme of the workshop was ‘Making Holocaust Oral Testimonies more usable as Research Data’ 
and was a practical hackathon style event where curators of oral history recordings, Holocaust researchers, digital humanists and language technologists got together to work on making oral testimony recordings more usable as research data.
Ignatius and Paul demonstrated the project's Python notebooks which illustrate what can be achieved using a combination of various
NLP methods applied to extract named entities and other geospatial features from text.
