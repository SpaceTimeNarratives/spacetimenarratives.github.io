On Sunday 2nd July 2023, the project team ran a workshop called 'Spatial Humanities: Finding spatial and time narratives in corpus data'
at the Corpus Linguistics (CL2023) conference, hosted at Lancaster University in the UK. 
Our workshop explored practical solutions for corpus linguists, digital humanists and computing researchers to study time and spatial relationships in corpora.

Attendees at the workshop used our bespoke Python Notebooks and Streamlit based visualisation demos, and all code and data was made
available open source and open access at the workshop. 

The Python Notebooks that participants used are available on 
[our GitHub repository](https://github.com/SpaceTimeNarratives/demo).
